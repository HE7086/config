# My Configuration

This is the configuration of my ubuntu machine.


There's also a setup script for quick installing.


## Quick Installation
run this for full install (which is not recommand for most people except myself)
```shell
sudo sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/he7086/config/master/setup_full.sh)"
```


run this for basic install (only contains zsh, git and their themes)
```shell
sudo sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/he7086/config/master/setup_basic.sh)"
```


## Warning: the script is still under test
## DO NOT run carelessly
